<h1>Endpoints</h1>
<p>
  We have two types of endpoints: those that require authentication and those that do not. <br />
  <h3>Some endpoints accept "lang" as a query parameter <a href="./language/readme.md">Here</a> is the list of languages. </h3>
</p>

<br />

<h2>Open Endpoints</h2>
These endpoints are available to all users, no token is required to access them.

### Media Data 🎥

Each endpoint provides information related to the media type being searched for.
* **`/api/media`** > [Show Details.](./media/README.md)

### Authentication 🔑

These endpoints are for user authentication (registration, login, and logout).

## Endpoints that require Authentication

Closed endpoints require a valid Token to be included in the header of the
request. A Token can be acquired from the Authentication EndPoints (Register / Login).
